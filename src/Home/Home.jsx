          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Wajeeha, a multitasker by heart and a go-getter by
            choice. My journey started in my 3rd semester when I took my first
            step into the professional world with customer experienceâ€”a decision
            that raised eyebrows. "Why are you doing this?" they asked. But I
            believed in my ability to multitask, explore beyond boundaries, and
            grow in multiple domains. Coming from a software engineering
            background, I didnâ€™t stop there. While handling customer
            interactions, I was also diving into coding, sharpening my skills,
            and soon stepping into the world of development. Over time, I
            specialized in React, Next.js, and modern web technologies, building
            scalable and user-friendly applications. Alongside development, I
            embraced my role as a virtual assistant, managing tasks efficiently
            and optimizing workflows. For me, it has always been simple: Follow
            your passion. Do what makes you happy. No rules, no limitationsâ€”just
            continuous learning, building, and evolving. ðŸš€ Letâ€™s connect and
            collaborateâ€”because great minds think alike!
